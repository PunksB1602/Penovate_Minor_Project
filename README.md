# Penovate 
> **Official implementation of the paper: "Inertial Sensing–Based Real-Time Handwritten Character Recognition Using a CNN–BiLSTM Architecture"**

Penovate is a hardware–software system for recognizing handwritten characters (a–z) written on ordinary paper, using a custom sensor-equipped pen and a deep learning model. The system is primarily designed and optimized for isolated single-character recognition, but may also work for continuous word or sequence input (with reduced accuracy, as this is not the main use case).


**Key Features:**
- Low-cost, portable pen device with IMU and FSR sensors
- Real-time data acquisition and Bluetooth transmission
- Signal processing and segmentation pipeline
- Deep learning models for single-character recognition (CNN-BiLSTM, with/without BatchNorm)
- May work for continuous words, but not optimized for that use case
- Reproducible experiments and results

**Model Names:**
- `CNN_BiLSTM`: Main model used in experiments (in `hybrid_CNN_BiLSTM.ipynb`) for single-character recognition, combining convolutional and bidirectional LSTM layers
- `CNN_LSTM`: Alternative implementation in `model.ipynb` with similar architecture (early testing only)
- Experiments include versions with and without Batch Normalization for comparison

This README provides a detailed overview of the hardware, firmware, data pipeline, model architecture, training setup, results, and usage instructions for single-character recognition.

## 1. Background and Motivation

Handwriting recognition has been studied extensively, with approaches ranging from **optical character recognition (OCR)** on scanned documents to **stylus-based digitizers** on tablets. However, most existing systems have limitations:

- OCR requires scanning or imaging, which is not real-time.  
- Stylus-based systems require specialized touchscreens or tablets.  
- Existing smart pens are often proprietary and expensive.

**Objective**: Develop an **open, low-cost, portable pen device** that enables handwriting capture on ordinary paper and converts it into digital characters in real time.  

**Key idea**: Use **inertial measurement units (IMUs)** to capture motion, an **FSR sensor** to detect strokes, and **deep sequence models** to recognize characters from the resulting time-series data.

---

## 2. System Overview

The Penovate system consists of four layers:

1. **Hardware Layer**  
   - A pen prototype equipped with sensors and Bluetooth module.  
   - Handles data acquisition during handwriting.  

2. **Firmware Layer**  
   - Arduino Nano firmware for synchronizing and transmitting IMU + FSR data.  

3. **Data Pipeline Layer**  
   - Preprocessing: filtering, segmentation, normalization.  
   - Converts raw sensor streams into fixed-length sequences.  

4. **Recognition Layer**  
   - A CNN–BiLSTM deep learning model trained to classify characters a–z.

### 2.1 Hardware Components

- **Arduino Nano (ATmega328p)** – microcontroller for acquisition.  
- **Two MPU-6050 IMUs** – capture accelerometer and gyroscope signals.  
- **Force-Sensitive Resistor (FSR)** – detects pen–paper contact and stroke boundaries.  
- **HC-05 Bluetooth module** – wireless transmission to host machine.  
- **Li-ion battery (2S, 7.4V)** – portable power source.  

---

### 2.2 Firmware Functionality

- Initializes I²C communication with two MPU-6050 sensors (addresses `0x68` and `0x69`).  
- Reads accelerometer and gyroscope data at fixed frequency (100 Hz).  
- Reads pressure data from FSR.  
- Formats sensor data into structured packets.  
- Streams packets over serial/Bluetooth to the host computer.  

---

### 2.3 Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Acquisition**: Sensor streams (accelerometer, gyroscope, pressure).  
2. **Filtering**: Low-pass Butterworth filter (order 2, cutoff 20 Hz) removes high-frequency noise.  
3. **Segmentation**: Pressure threshold from FSR marks stroke start/end.  
4. **Feature Engineering**: Relative motion computed between two IMUs (imu1 - imu2), concatenated with original signals (12 → 18 features).  
5. **Normalization (Collection)**: Per-sequence z-score normalization during data collection.  
6. **Splitting**: Dataset split into train/val/test (70%/15%/15%) with stratification.  
7. **Normalization (Training)**: Global normalization using training set statistics.  
8. **Augmentation**: Training data augmented with noise (σ=0.05) and random scaling (0.8-1.2×), generating 2 copies per sample.  
9. **Padding**: Sequences zero-padded to fixed length (184 timesteps, 95th percentile) for batching.  

**Data Preprocessing Summary:**
- **Collection Phase** (`dataset_collection.py`):
  - Butterworth low-pass filter (order 2, 20 Hz cutoff)
  - Relative motion calculation between IMUs (creates 18 features)
  - Per-sequence z-score normalization
  - Segmentation via START/END signals from FSR
- **Training Phase** (`process_imu_data.py`):
  - Train/Val/Test split: 70%/15%/15% (stratified)
  - Fixed sequence length: 184 timesteps (95th percentile)
  - Zero-padding for shorter sequences
  - Global normalization using training set statistics
  - Data augmentation: Gaussian noise (σ=0.05) + random scaling (0.8-1.2×)
  - Label encoding and mapping (see `label_map.json`)

## 3. Dataset

**Classes:** 26 lowercase English letters (a–z), single character recognition.
**Format:** Each character's samples are stored in separate JSON files (e.g., `a_lower.json`, `b_lower.json`) in the `imu_dataset` directory. Each file contains a list of preprocessed sensor sequences for that character.

**Raw Signals Recorded (12 channels):**
   - Accelerometer (x, y, z) from IMU 1
   - Gyroscope (x, y, z) from IMU 1
   - Accelerometer (x, y, z) from IMU 2
   - Gyroscope (x, y, z) from IMU 2

**Computed Features (18 channels total):**
   - Original IMU 1 data: 6 channels (acc_x, acc_y, acc_z, gyro_x, gyro_y, gyro_z)
   - Original IMU 2 data: 6 channels (acc_x, acc_y, acc_z, gyro_x, gyro_y, gyro_z)
   - Relative motion (IMU1 - IMU2): 6 channels (differential motion between pen tip and body)

**Sampling frequency:** 100 Hz  
**Samples:** ~130 per class, custom collected by two different writers  
**Collection method:** Hardware pen device with real-time sensor acquisition  

**Data Collection & Preprocessing Pipeline:**
- Data is collected via a serial connection from the pen hardware.
- Each sample is a time-series sequence, recorded between `START` and `END` signals.
- Preprocessing steps for each sequence:
   1. **Low-pass Butterworth filtering** (order 2, cutoff 20 Hz) is applied to all sensor channels.
   2. **Relative motion** is computed between the two IMUs (imu1 - imu2), and concatenated with the original IMU data.
   3. **Normalization**: Each channel is normalized (zero mean, unit variance) per sequence.
   4. The processed sequence is appended to the character's dataset.
- Data is saved in files named `{char}_lower.json` or `{char}_upper.json` (for lowercase/uppercase), containing lists of sequences.
- The dataset is later converted to `.npy` format for model training.

**Note:** The current model and dataset are designed for single lowercase character recognition (a–z). Recognition of continuous words or uppercase characters is not supported in this version.

**Data Example:**
Each character sample is stored as a JSON file with synchronized sensor readings and label. Data is converted to `.npy` arrays for efficient training.

- Most misclassifications occurred between visually or motion-similar letters (e.g., M vs N, C vs G).
- The model is **highly reliable for isolated character recognition**.
- Recognition of continuous words or sentences remains a challenge and is a direction for future work.
- Training was stable and reproducible due to deterministic settings and fixed seeds.
- The data pipeline and preprocessing steps (filtering, segmentation, normalization) were crucial for robust model performance.
